This tutorial demonstrates how to use QOBRA-PennyLane to solve Max-Cut problems using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).

## What is Max-Cut?

The Maximum Cut (Max-Cut) problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem where we want to partition the vertices of a graph into two sets such that the number of edges between the sets is maximized.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed QOBRA-PennyLane:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
