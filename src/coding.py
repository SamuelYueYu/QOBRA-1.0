QOBRA - Coding Module

This module handles the encoding and decoding of molecular sequences for quantum processing.
It converts molecular sequences into quantum-compatible representations and vice versa.
Key functionality includes:
- Molecular sequence preprocessing and validation
- Quantum state encoding/decoding
- Functional site analysis
- Sequence similarity calculations

The current implementation works with protein sequences as an example, where functional
sites are marked with '+' and segments are separated by ':'. The framework is designed
to be adaptable to other molecular sequence types.
